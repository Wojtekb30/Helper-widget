# Helper widget
A desktop widget written in Python which supports Wolfram Alpha and language translator. Ask it anything!

<b> Download and what to do before the first launch: </b>

Download the Python file, install needed libraries via pip, before first launch paste Wolfram Alpha API key in the first line. There is also a line which, as comment says, can be deleted to disable always-on-top.

Wolfram Alpha API website: https://products.wolframalpha.com/simple-api/documentation

After pasting the valid API key, just run the Python script and use the program.

<b> How to use the program? </b>

Wolfram Alpha:

On top there is a text input field. Let's call it the question field. You can type the text for Wolfram Alpha into it. 
Underneath there are two buttons. Click "Send to Wolfram" button to send the text from the question field to the service. The answer will then appear in the big text field down.

Translator:

Type or paste the text to translate into the big text field down (the one in which Wolfram Alpha's answers appear). In the question field (the text input on top) type source and destination language, separate them with "-" (for example pl-en, es-japanese, auto-en [in these examples: pl-en will translate from Polish to English, es-japanese from Spanish to Japanese and auto-en will translate from auto-detected language to English]). Then press the "Translate" button.
